# Miserly
This is a submission repo for codefundo-2018
We plan to make a javascript based web app which could be used to keep a check on savings and expenses on monthly basis.

## Possible Functions
* A monthly budget that can be manually set which will keep a count on how much percentage of the budget is used or still left to spend.
* List of all the transactions as in where or with whom they have been made, with a feature of adding notes as well.
* Pending transactions or debts that have to be completed from the user's end or if the user is a receiver, how much others owe him.
* Show the user savings or how much more he has spent in a particular month.
* To split expenses for a group.
## Future Aspects
* Try to link the app with the bank account
* Allow the user to set a date and time as in when he needs to pay his debts and send a notification to remind him for the same as well.
* Provide a smart chatting interface for the user and his alliances and ask them automatically to set a reminder for paying their debts       whenever a date is encountered in the chats.
